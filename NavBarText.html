            <div id='faqsTitle'>FAQs</div>
            Q: Your return policy states that anything more than 2-1/2 scratches renders an item unreturnable.
            How do you calculate the length of that last half-scratch - is it relative to the other scratches, or does it
            have it's own objective measurement?
            <br>A:Yes.<br><br>
            Q: My item never arrived.<br>
            A: Not our problem. Check your tracking number and call UPS.<br><br>
            Q: How do you manage to keep your prices so low?<br>
            A: Why? Are you a competitor? Ha-ha we won't tell!<br><br>
            Q: If I purchase multiple items will they all be shipped together?<br>
            A: It depends.<br><br>
